1. How many lines of code written
Around 200 lines of code written

2. Analysis of complexity for all important parts of the code
BFS: O(|V| + |E|)
DFS: O(|V| + |E|) 
SCC (Kosaraju-Sharir): O(|V| + |E|)
MST (Prim): O(|E| log |V|)
SSSP (Dijkstra): not yet implemented

3. Progress on solving theory problem (status of proofs)
N/A

4. What challenges you're facing
Making the API as simple as possible and eliminating unneeded complexity.

5. Lessons learned so far
Usability and readability of an API is analogous with its usefulness.
It's pretty difficult to ensure that the code is readable and clear.
It's also a subjective thing whether or not something is easy to use or not.

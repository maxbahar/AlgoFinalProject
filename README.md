## CSCI3383 Algorithms Final Project
Author: Maximilian Bahar

I will work on the **default final project** and extend homework 5's graph API.

The following graph operations will be added:
* Strongly Connected Components (SSC) for directed graphs using Kosaraju
* Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for undirected graphs using Kruskall or Prim
* Single-source Shortest Path (SSSP) for weighted directed graphs using Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra
